# TTC Project

## Project structure

This repo is a monolith structure with loose coupling between each of the 3 react
sites (thus they all have their own package.json etc) and the api. This is to make
it easy to distibute the sites to different servers/EB environments if scaling
requires it.

The structure should save us having to jump back and forth between repos.

## Developing

If you just want to have everything setup and running for you, you can use
`docker-compose up --build` from the top level directory to have all 3 react sites
run, along with the golang backend. Depending on your computer, this take a while to
run the first time, be patient.

After you have run `docker-compose up --build` the first time, you can run it without
the build flag `docker-compose up` and it should speed up significantly.

By default, after successful start of the docker containers the services are running at:

port : service

- 3000 : Delegate frontend (TODO)
- 3001 : Delegate storybook (TODO)

- 4000 : Manager frontend
- 4001 : Manager storybook

- 5000 : Admin Frontend

- 8080 : Golang API

**Don't use docker at your own risk, it handles a lot of the heavy lifting**

### Running only certain services

If you only wish to run the services separately you can run `docker-compose up api_db` to
just run the API database (which is available at port 5430, so as not to interfear with others).
Other services can be run separetely with:

- `docker-compose up api` (for the API, note this also starts the DB)
- `docker-compose up api_db` (just for the database at port 5430)
- `docker-compose up admin` (for the admin react)
- `docker-compose up manager` (for the manager react)

Its also much faster when you need to rebuild a particular service, just to run `docker-compose build <service>`
rather than having to rebuild the entire thing.

### GraphQL API

The graphQL api is run from `http://localhost:8080/graphql`, a simple example request
can be found here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7917882/SzYW3ftG?version=latest

## Issues with docker + postgres

Database migrations mixed in with changing branches etc can cause your database to be in a weird state
to sort this out just run `docker-compose up --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes api_db` to put your
database (and everything else) back to its initial state.

> You will also need to run this when altering details about database columns, GORM won't add something
> like a unique constraint if it has already created the column, so running this will sort that.

##Â Production
When building into production the docker containers are all split into separate
EB applications so that they can be load balanced and monitored separately.
